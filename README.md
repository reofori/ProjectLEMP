# Project Documentation: Deployment of LEMP Stack on EC2 Instance

## Overview
This repository contains documentation for setting up a LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack on an Amazon EC2 instance. The LEMP stack is a robust and popular web development environment that provides all the necessary components to run dynamic websites and web applications efficiently.

### Stack Components
Our setup utilizes the following technologies:

- **Linux:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- **Engine-X (Nginx):** High-performance HTTP server
- **MySQL:** Reliable relational database management system
- **PHP:** Versatile server-side scripting language

This combination offers a powerful, scalable, and flexible platform for web development and deployment.
